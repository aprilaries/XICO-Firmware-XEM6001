Keep these in mind next time when you stop by a Target restroom:
- You don't know your gender till you measure it, unless you are in one of the eigenstates.
- You gender depends on how you measure it.
- You may change your gender with a series of measurements.
- You gender may be determined by a measurement on your partner, if you two are entangled.
Although you are supposed to be a 'classical' creature, you have the right to be treated as a quantum existence.
