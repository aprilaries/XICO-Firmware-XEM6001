<tr><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: 0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to 1.260 Volts)</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>WARNING&nbsp;</td><td>Pack:1653 - At least one timing constraint is impossible to meet because component delays alone exceed the constraint. A timing constraint summary below shows the failing constraints (preceded with an Asterisk (*)). Please use the Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line) with the Mapped NCD and PCF files to identify which constraints and paths are failing because of the component delays alone. If the failing path(s) is mapped to Xilinx components as expected, consider relaxing the constraint. If it is not mapped to components as expected, re-evaluate your HDL and how synthesis is optimizing the path. To allow the tools to bypass this error, set the environment variable XIL_TIMING_ALLOW_IMPOSSIBLE to 1.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing Analyzer Reference manual; for more information on TRCE, consult the Xilinx Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 100 IOs, 99 are locked and 1 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs, please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1.</td><td>New</td></tr>
<tr><td>WARNING&nbsp;</td><td>Place:1137 - This design is not guaranteed to be routable! This design contains a global buffer instance, &lt;pulse_picker/QCLK/clkout2_buf&gt;, driving the net, &lt;pulse_picker/wClk4X&gt;, that is driving the following (first 30) non-clock load pins.
&lt; PIN: pulse_picker/Mmux_wClk11.A5; &gt;
This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock loads. Please pay extra attention to the timing and routing of this path to ensure the design goals are met. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN &lt;pulse_picker/QCLK/clkout2_buf.O&gt; allowing your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
