<tr><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>Timing:3412 - To improve timing, see the Timing Closure User Guide (UG612).</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>Timing:2752 - To get complete path coverage, use the unconstrained paths option. All paths that are not constrained will be reported in the unconstrained paths section(s) of the report.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>Timing:3339 - The clock-to-out numbers in this timing report are based on a 50 Ohm transmission line loading model.  For the details of this model, and for more information on accounting for different loading conditions, please see the device datasheet.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></table>
